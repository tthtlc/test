          Calling `unserialize()` with user input in the pattern can lead to    
  arbitrary code execution.                                                     
          Consider using JSON or structured data approaches (e.g. Google        
  Protocol Buffers).

          Detected non-constant file inclusion. This can lead to local file     
  inclusion (LFI) or remote                                                     
          file inclusion (RFI) if user input reaches this statement. LFI and RFI
  could lead to                                                                 
          sensitive files being obtained by attackers. Instead, explicitly      
  specify what to include. If                                                   
          that is not a viable solution, validate user input thoroughly.
