          An attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining       
  complete control of the                                                       
          system. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands    
  with user input. If this                                                      
          is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the user input, and use safe    
  methods for executing the                                                     
          commands. In PHP, it is possible to use `escapeshellcmd(...)` and     
  `escapeshellarg(...)` to                                                      
          correctly sanitize input that is used respectively as system commands 
  or command arguments.
